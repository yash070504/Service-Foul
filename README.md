# Volleyball Foul Detection System

This project detects service faults in volleyball using sensor-based technology. It leverages Arduino for data collection and Python with a machine learning model for obstacle detection.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `Arduino/`: Contains Arduino code and circuit diagrams.
- `Python/`: Contains ML model and scripts to process Arduino data.
- `data/`: (Optional) Labeled data for training.
- `videos/`: (Optional) Demonstrations and tutorials.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## âš™ Setup Instructions

### Arduino

1. Open `foul_detection.ino` in Arduino IDE.
2. Upload the code to Arduino.
3. Connect sensors as per diagrams in `circuit_diagrams.pdf`.

### Python

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r Python/requirements.txt
   ```

## âœ… Next Steps

1. Create these folders on your system.
2. Copy the Arduino code into `foul_detection.ino`.
3. Copy the Python script into `obstacle_detection.py`.
4. Create `requirements.txt` with the dependencies listed.
5. Write or copy your circuit diagrams into `circuit_diagrams.pdf`.
6. Optionally, collect data and store it in `labeled_data.csv`.

Let me know if you want me to generate these files (like `requirements.txt` or `README.md`) as downloadable files ready for your project!
